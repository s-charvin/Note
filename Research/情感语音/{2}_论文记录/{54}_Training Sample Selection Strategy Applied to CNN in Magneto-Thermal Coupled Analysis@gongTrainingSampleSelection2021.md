## 摘要

> [!abstract] Deep learning (DL) has attracted more and more attention in computational electromagnetism. Particularly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular learning models in DL due to its excellent capacity for feature extraction and convergence. The efficiency of CNN mainly depends on how many training samples are needed to effectively converge the network. The sample preparation process often involves a lot of numerical computations, which can be very expensive and time-consuming. In this article, based on the traditional DL network training procedure, two different approaches, namely adding smart training samples and reference samples, are proposed to help the DL network converge. The smart sample selection is based on a greedy algorithm, which can be applied for both training and reference samples. The influences of these two approaches on the CNN training process are investigated by an example of the coupled magneto-thermal computation applied to a transformer. Numerical results show that the two proposed approaches can significantly help the network to converge and improve the efficiency of the DL model.
