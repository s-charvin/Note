## 摘要

> [!abstract] Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an appealing approach to resolve generalization problem for speech emotion recognition (SER) systems. By utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data, SSL is able to gain extra information about the prior distribution of the data. Typically, it can lead to better and robust recognition performance. Existing SSL approaches for SER include variations of encoder-decoder model structures such as autoencoder (AE) and variational autoecoders (VAEs), where it is difficult to interpret the learning mechanism behind the latent space. In this study, we introduce a new SSL framework, which we refer to as the DeepEmoCluster framework, for attribute-based SER tasks. The DeepEmoCluster framework is an end-to-end model with mel-spectrogram inputs, which combines a self-supervised pseudo labeling classification network with a supervised emotional attribute regressor. The approach encourages the model to learn latent representations by maximizing the emotional separation of K-means clusters. Our experimental results based on the MSP-Podcast corpus indicate that the DeepEmoCluster framework achieves competitive prediction performances in fully supervised scheme, outperforming baseline methods in most of the conditions. The approach can be further improved by incorporating extra unlabeled set. Moreover, our experimental results explicitly show that the latent clusters have emotional dependencies, enriching the geometric interpretation of the clusters.
