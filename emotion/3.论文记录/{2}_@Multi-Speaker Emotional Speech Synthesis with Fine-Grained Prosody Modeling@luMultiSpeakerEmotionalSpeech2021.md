## 摘要

> [!abstract] We present an end-to-end system for multi-speaker emotional speech synthesis. In particular, our system learns emotion classes from just two speakers then generalizes these classes to other speakers from whom no emotional data was seen. We address the problem by integrating disentangled, fine-grained prosody features with global, sentence-level emotion embedding. These fine-grained features learn to represent local prosodic variations disentangled from speaker, tone and global emotion label. Compared to systems that model emotions at sentence level only, our method achieves higher ratings in naturalness and expressiveness, while retaining comparable speaker similarity ratings.
